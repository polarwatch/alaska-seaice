# Visualization of Sea Ice Data in Alaskan Fisheries Management Regions

This repository contains scripts for creating a data visualization webpage 
that displays sea ice data time series across the Alaskan fisheries management regions.

This collaborative project involves PolarWatch, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AKFSC), 
and the Alaska Fisheries Information Network (AKFIN). It aims to monitor sea ice trends 
and highlight the potential applications of sea ice data in research and resource management.

The project was initiated in 2024, and the development version of the webpage is 
currently available for viewing at https://polarwatch.github.io/alaska-seaice/.

The description of the data and methods used to compute the time series can be found [here](https://polarwatch.github.io/alaska-seaice/methods.html).  

Objectives of the Project:
* To visualize and make available downloadable time series data of key sea ice indicators.
* To provide a platform for PolarWatch to disseminate information and resources related to sea ice.
