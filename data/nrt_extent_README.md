# Metadata for Daily Sea Ice Extent Time Serie from Near Real Time Data 

## Description
The daily sea ice extent for the two most recent available years 
was computed using the NOAA/NSIDC near real-time sea ice concentration data (SIC)
You can access the SIC data at https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nsidcG10016v2nh1day.html

The remote sensing data were cropped to fit within the boundaries of 
each ecosystem fisheries management region, and the sea ice extent 
was calculated using a SIC threshold of 0.15. 

For more detailed methods and the Python code used, 
please refer to the methods section and the GitHub repository.
