Title: Annualized Sea Ice Extent Computation for Alaska Regions
Author: Sunny Bak Hospital
Date: October 8, 2024
Description:
    This script computes the 'annualized' sea ice extent for multiple regions in Alaska from 1985 to the 
    most current year, using the SIC25k class from the `pw_data` module. Region-specific shapefiles for 
    Alaska Fisheries Ecosystem Management Regions are read, reprojected to the Polar Stereographic 
    coordinate system (EPSG:3413), and used to subset and process sea ice concentration data from the NSIDC dataset.

    The annual sea ice extent is calculated over the period from September 1 of each year to August 31 of the following 
    year (e.g., September 2023 to August 2024 for Year 2024). Monthly sea ice extent values are averaged 
    to produce an annualized sea ice extent value. The results are saved in CSV format for each defined region.

    The sea ice extent values for all years, except the most recent, were computed using the CDR 
    sea ice concentration data. Values for the most recent year were calculated using Near-Real-Time data.


Regions:
- Alaskan Arctic
- Northern Bering Sea
- Eastern Bering Sea
- Southeastern Bering Sea

Dependencies:
- pw_data (specifically, SIC25k class for sea ice concentration data handling)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- pandas (data handling and CSV export)
- geopandas (geospatial data processing)
- dask (for parallel computing) 
- gc (garbage collection)
- datetime (for managing date ranges)

Parameters:
- CRS: EPSG:3413 (Polar Stereographic)
- NRT_DAILY_ID: 'nsidcG10016v2nh1day' for near-real-time daily data
- GRID_CELL_AREA_ID: 'pstere_gridcell_N25k'
- VAR_NAME: 'cdr_seaice_conc'

Usage:
    Run this script to compute and export the annual sea ice extent for each defined Alaska region to CSV files.
