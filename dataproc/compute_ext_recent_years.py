"""
This script computes sea ice extent for multiple regions in the Alaskan Arctic and Bering Sea
using the SIC25k class from the `pw_data` module. It reads region-specific shapefiles, 
transforms them into the proper coordinate reference system (CRS), and processes sea ice concentration data 
from the NSIDC dataset to calculate the sea ice extent within the regions.

Sea ice extent is computed for each region for the time period of September 1 (last year) to December 31 (this year). 
The results are saved as CSV files, where sea ice concentration is thresholded into binary values (0 or 1) 
and sea ice extent is computed in square kilometers.

Dependencies:
- os
- sys
- geopandas
- datetime
- matplotlib
- pw_data (specifically, the SIC25k class)
