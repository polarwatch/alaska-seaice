```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The script shows how to export the shape geometries of Alaska fisheries management ecosystem regions.


```{r get-shape}
library(AKmarineareas)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
## plot NMFS areas
AK_marine_area()%>%
  st_shift_longitude()%>% #centers on the Pacific
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf()+
  geom_sf_label(aes(label=NMFS_REP_AREA))+
  theme_void()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
