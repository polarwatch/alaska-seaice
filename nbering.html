<p>The time series plot and data summary below present statistics on sea ice extent within northern Bering Sea computed from the remote sensing data from NOAA/NSIDC on PolarWatch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mean (1991-2020): Represents the average sea ice extent from 1991-2020.</li>
<li>Upper and Lower Bounds of Error Band (1991-2020): Reflect the uncertainty of the Mean.</li>
<li>Current and Previous Year: Show the daily sea ice extent values for the current and previous year within the area.</li>
