You can click on the links below or on the sidebar to view and download the daily time series for each region. The regional data are updated daily, with approximately a 2-day lag when new data become available.\nSea ice extent refers to the total area where snow or ice is present and is calculated using sea ice concentration data from NOAA PolarWatch.\nThe Alaska region is made up of distinct large marine ecosystems across: the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), Aleutian Islands (AI), eastern Bering Sea (EBS), northern Bering Sea (a subset of EBS), and Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Seas (referred to here as the Alaskan Arctic). Fishery management areas include the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands. No federal fisheries currently occur in the Alaskan Arctic.\nThe website features sea ice extent data for three regions defined by the Ecosystem Management Regions:\n\nthe Alaskan Arctic\nthe Eastern Bering Sea\nthe Northern Bering Sea (a subset of the Eastern Bering sea).\nthe Southeastern Bering Sea (a subset of the Eastern Bering sea).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arctic maps from the NSIDC display sea ice extent values (left) and sea ice concentration values (right). A grid cell in the sea ice extent map (left) is assigned a value of 1 when the sea ice concentration fraction (right) is greater than or equal to a threshold of 15%.",

This can be estimated using satellite microwave radiometers. To compute the sea ice extent baseline (i.e., the 30-year climatology), satellite Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 were pulled from PolarWatch. The sea ice extent values of the two most recent years were computed using the Near-real-time Sea Ice Concentration data.\nClimate Data Record (CDR) of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration\nThis data set provides a CDR of sea ice concentration at 25 km resolution. Daily and monthly versions are available from 1978 to the most recent annual processing. The data are deemed of science quality.

Link to Data\nPolar Stereographic Grid Cell Area\nThis dataset includes grid cell area values for the 25-km polar stereographic grid used for the sea ice concentration data. Link to Data\n\n\n\nSea ice extent is calculated as the sum of the areas of each grid cell where the sea ice concentration meets or exceeds a specified threshold, indicating the presence of sea ice. Typically, that threshold is 0.15 (i.e. when the sea ice concentration estimated in that grid cell is 15% of greater, the area of the entire grid cell is used to calculate the sea ice extent). Alternatively, one can also calculate the sea ice area, in which case the grid cell area is multiplied by the sea ice concentration. Here, we work with sea ice extent.\n\n\nLet \\(sic_{ij}\\) be the satellite estimated sea ice concentration (i.e., fraction) of the \\(ij^{th}\\) grid cell covered by sea ice.\nSea ice extent of a \\({region}\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\\text{region, time}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{xgrid}, j \\in \\text{ygrid}} seaice_{ij,\\text{region, time}} \\cdot \\text{cellarea}_{ij, \\text{region}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text {where}\n\\ seaice_{ij, region, time} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } sic_{ij,\\text{region, time}} \\geq 0.15, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWorkflow of Data Processing and Computation:\n\nData Import for Baseline Import Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1991 to 2020 within the specified regional boundaries to compute daily baseline.\nData Import for most recent years Import Near-Real-Time sea ice concentration data to the CDR time series.\nData Cleaning Remove all flag values (non-sea ice concentration values) from the dataset.\nData Conversion Convert sea ice concentration values from fractions to binary values using a threshold of 0.15 (0 indicates no ice, 1 indicates ice presence).\nSea Ice Extent Calculation Sum the grid cell areas across all grids to obtain the total sea ice extent within the regional boundaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent baseline for a given region was computed using sea ice extent from 1991 to 2020 based on the NOAA’s recommendadtions, and defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}} = Mean (\\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, day, year} \\in [1985, 2015]})\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent anomaly for a given region was computed using sea ice extent baseline:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent anomaly}_{\\text{region, day, year}} = \\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, day, year}} - \\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe annualized sea ice extent for a given region was computed by averaging monthly sea ice extent values.\n\\[\n\\text{Annualized sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, year}} = \\text{Mean} \\left( \\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, date in [September (year-1), August (year)]}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe data processing and computation was performed using Python and the webpage generation and visualization were done using Quartot and R. The codes are available in dataproc/ directory of the github repository.\n\n\n\n\nThe intended use of the data summaries, which include sea ice extent baselines and anomalies, is to compare the recent year’s sea ice extent against the 30-year baseline of sea ice extent. It is important to note that no additional data cleaning has been performed beyond what is described here.

    "text": "Sea ice extent is calculated as the sum of the areas of each grid cell where the sea ice concentration meets or exceeds a specified threshold, indicating the presence of sea ice. Typically, that threshold is 0.15 (i.e. when the sea ice concentration estimated in that grid cell is 15% of greater, the area of the entire grid cell is used to calculate the sea ice extent). Alternatively, one can also calculate the sea ice area, in which case the grid cell area is multiplied by the sea ice concentration. Here, we work with sea ice extent.\n\n\nLet \\(sic_{ij}\\) be the satellite estimated sea ice concentration (i.e., fraction) of the \\(ij^{th}\\) grid cell covered by sea ice.\nSea ice extent of a \\({region}\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\\text{region, time}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{xgrid}, j \\in \\text{ygrid}} seaice_{ij,\\text{region, time}} \\cdot \\text{cellarea}_{ij, \\text{region}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text {where}\n\\ seaice_{ij, region, time} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } sic_{ij,\\text{region, time}} \\geq 0.15, \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nWorkflow of Data Processing and Computation:\n\nData Import for Baseline Import Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1991 to 2020 within the specified regional boundaries to compute daily baseline.\nData Import for most recent years Import Near-Real-Time sea ice concentration data to the CDR time series.\nData Cleaning Remove all flag values (non-sea ice concentration values) from the dataset.\nData Conversion Convert sea ice concentration values from fractions to binary values using a threshold of 0.15 (0 indicates no ice, 1 indicates ice presence).\nSea Ice Extent Calculation Sum the grid cell areas across all grids to obtain the total sea ice extent within the regional boundaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent baseline for a given region was computed using sea ice extent from 1991 to 2020 based on the NOAA’s recommendadtions, and defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}} = Mean (\\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, day, year} \\in [1985, 2015]})\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe daily sea ice extent anomaly for a given region was computed using sea ice extent baseline:\n\\[\n\\text{Sea ice extent anomaly}_{\\text{region, day, year}} = \\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, day, year}} - \\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\\text{region, day}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe annualized sea ice extent for a given region was computed by averaging monthly sea ice extent values.\n\\[\n\\text{Annualized sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, year}} = \\text{Mean} \\left( \\text{Sea ice extent}_{\\text{region, date in [September (year-1), August (year)]}} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe data processing and computation was performed using Python and the webpage generation and visualization were done using Quartot and R. The codes are available in dataproc/ directory of the github repository.",
