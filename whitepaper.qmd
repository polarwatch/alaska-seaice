# Sea ice Extent in Alaska region

This website present monthly time series and anomalies for sea ice extent within the management regions of Alaskan waters.


The website features sea ice extent data for three regions: the Alaskan Arctic, Northern Bering, and Eastern Bering Sea. The boundaries of these regions are defined by the Ecosystem Management Regions. #TODO: add link to the management region

Sea ice extent for each region is calculated using sea ice concentration data available from NOAA PolarWatch and is updated automatically when the new data are available.

Documentation for the calculation of sea ice extent is available on the [Polarwatch github repository]().


## Data

To compute the baseline sea ice extent, Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to 2015 monthly data were pulled from [PolarWatch](https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/catalog/ice-sq-nh-nsidc-cdr-v4/preview/?dataset=monthly&var=cdr_seaice_conc_monthly&time_min=2023-12-01T00:00:00Z&time_max=2023-12-01T00:00:00Z&proj=epsg3413&colorBar=KT_ice,,,0,1,).  

To provide a continuous and near-real-time time series of sea ice extent, the Near-real-time sea ice concentration  

__Climate Data Record (CDR) Sea Ice Concentration NSIDC Climate Data Record V4, Arctic__

25-km science quality sea ice concentration data for the Arctic from the NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record, Version 4 (G02202). This data set provides a Climate Data Record (CDR) of sea ice concentration from passive microwave data. Daily and monthly versions are available from 1978 to the most recent annual processing.


__Near-real-time Sea Ice Concentration__

25-km sea ice concentration data for the Arctic from the Near Real-Time NOAA/NSIDC Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record (G10016_v2). Daily and monthly versions are available with data beginning Jan 2021. The NRT CDR fills the temporal gap between annual updates of the final CDR providing the most recent data available.

__Polar Stereographic Grid Cell Area Values__

This dataset includes grid cell area values of 25-km polar stereographic projected map as ancillary data to the 25-km sea ice concentration data.  

## Methods and Workflow

Sea ice extent is calculated as the sum of the areas of each grid cell where the sea ice concentration meets or exceeds a specified threshold, indicating the presence of sea ice.


### Monthly Sea ice extent

Let $sic_{ij}$ be the sea ice concentration fraction of the $ij^{th}$ cell from the satellite data. 

Sea ice extent of a ${region}$ is defined as folows: 

$$
\text{Sea Ice Extent}_{\text{region,month}} = \sum_{i \in \text{xgrid}, j \in \text{ygrid}} seaice_{ij,\text{region,month}} \cdot \text{cellarea}_{ij,\text{region}}
$$

$$ 
\text {where} 
\ seaice_{ij,region,month} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } sic_{ij,\text{region,month}} \geq 0.15, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$


__Workflow of Data Processing and Computation:__

1.  __Data Import__ Import Climate Data Record (CDR) sea ice concentration data from 1985 to the most recent annual processing within the specified regional boundaries.

2. __Data Extension__ Append Near-Real-Time sea ice concentration data to the CDR time series to create an updated dataset with the latest available data.

3. __Data Cleaning__ Remove all flag values (non-sea ice concentration values) from the dataset.

4. __Data Conversion__ Convert sea ice concentration values from fractions to binary values using a threshold of 0.15 (0 indicates no ice, 1 indicates ice presence).

4. __Sea Ice Extent Calculation__ Sum the grid cell areas across all grids to obtain the total sea ice extent within the regional boundaries.


### Monthly sea ice extent baseline

The sea ice extent monthly baseline was computed using sea ice extent from 2015 to 2015, and defined as follows: 

Let $sea\_ice\_ext_{m,y}$ be  $mth$ monthly sea ice extent of the $yth$ year, sea ice extent baseline of a ${region}$ is defined as follows:

Mean Sea ice extent of a ${region}$ is defined as folows: 

$$
\text{Sea ice extent baseline}_{\text{region}} = Mean ( sea\_ice\_ext_{m,region,y \in [1985,2024]})
$$

### Data Processing

The data processing was performed using python code and the additional computation and data visualization were done using R.

## Metadata

Metadata follows the CF metadata standards and can be downloaded [here]().

## Intended Use

The intended use of the data summaries, which include sea ice extent baselines and anomalies, is to compare the recent year's sea ice extent against the approximately 30-year baseline of sea ice extent. It is important to note that no additional data cleaning has been performed beyond what is described here. Users are advised to conduct further evaluations of the data and analysis themselves.
